          Literacy has captured my attention, observing the untapped potential
          of teenagers that ought to be maximized. With the pervasive influence
          of social media, adolescents often find themselves spending
          considerable time scrolling, yet without significant improvement in
          competencies. Consequently, productivity declines, and there is a
          notable absence of exposure to essential literacy skills. This
          underscores the urgency for me to develop a platform that facilitates
          literacy learning and enhances productivity, enabling harnessing of
          potential from an early stage. I express gratitude and earnestly seek
          support in realizing this vision, aimed at fostering benefits for
          numerous teenagers across Indonesia.
